Welcome to the **ProPASS DataSHIELD Training** materials. This will guide you through performing federated data analysis using DataSHIELD, from data cleaning to statistical modelling.

::: {.callout-note}
## What is DataSHIELD?
DataSHIELD is a software infrastructure that enables the remote and non-disclosive analysis of sensitive research data. It allows researchers to analyze data across multiple sites without the data ever leaving its original location.
:::

## Overview

This materials cover two main modules:

### Module 1: Data Cleaning

Learn to prepare your data within the DataSHIELD environment:

- **Filtering & Subsetting**: Use filtering tools to subset datasets based on specified conditions
- **Conditional Operations**: Apply `ifelse()`-style conditional operations across variables and datasets
- **Derived Variables**: Create derived variables and perform grouped summaries
- **Table 1 Creation**: Produce descriptive summaries for participant characteristics using group-level statistics

### Module 2: Statistical Modelling

Master the statistical analysis tools available in DataSHIELD:

- **Generalized Linear Models**: Fit `ds.glm()` models within the DataSHIELD framework
- **Survival Analysis**: Run survival models using `ds.Surv()` and related functions
- **Compositional Data Analysis**: Execute CoDA scripts for compositional data

## Target Audience

- Researchers working with the ProPASS consortium data
- Epidemiologists and biostatisticians new to DataSHIELD
- Anyone interested in federated data analysis techniques

## Prerequisites

Before starting, please ensure you have:

- R (≥ 4.3.0) and RStudio installed
- Basic familiarity with R programming
- Understanding of basic statistical concepts (regression, survival analysis)

See [Prerequisites](1-prerequisites.qmd) for detailed setup instructions.

## Training Server

For this workshop, we use the public **OBiBa Opal demo server**:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **URL** | `https://opal-demo.obiba.org` |
| **Username** | `dsuser` |
| **Password** | `P@ssw0rd` |
| **Profile** | `margin-idiom` |

::: {.callout-tip}
## Why margin-idiom?
The `margin-idiom` profile includes the required DataSHIELD packages to follow the materials.
